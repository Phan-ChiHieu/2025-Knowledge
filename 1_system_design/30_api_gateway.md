# API Gateway

- An API gateway is centralized service that handles authentication, rate limiting, loging, monitoring, request routing and much more.

- Imagine a microservices-based application with multiple services

- Instead of exposing (**phơi bày**) each service directly, an API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client request.

-It routes (**định tuyến**) the request to the appropriate (**thích hợp**) microservice
